# CARO GAME
Caro (or Gomoku) is an abstract strategy board game and is also called Five in a row. It is traditionally played with go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board (19x19 intersections)

## Brief Introduction:
- Caro is a small game that allows two players play over the network. 
- Each player should join the Caro game room with a name. 
- After joining the room, a player can invite the other to play with. 
- The inviting can give a preferred board size (NxN). 
- The invited player should accept the inviting. 
- At the first time, the game will randomly choose who is the X -player right after the invited accepts the inviting. 
- When a game finished, a new game is started with the X-player is set to the player who was O-player in the previous game.
